            <h4>COVER LETTER OR MOTIVATION LETTER</h4>
            <div class="details">
                <h3>BIO</h3>
                <p>Hi i am reaching out to express my interest in transitioning from academia to an industry role in embedded systems or web
                development. For over a decade, I have built my career as an Assistant Professor in Electronics and
                Telecommunication, with a particular focus on embedded systems, IoT, digital circuit design, and web technologies.
                However, I am now eager to move into a dynamic industry environment where I can bring my skills to life in real-world
                applications and further contribute to innovative product development.</p>
                <p>Throughout my teaching and research journey, I have been deeply involved in both practical and theoretical aspects of
                technology. My responsibilities included leading courses on the Internet of Things, digital communication, and embedded
                systems, as well as guiding hands-on projects in web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP) and programming for
                microcontrollers like the STM32, 8051, and 8086. These experiences have given me a solid technical foundation and
                sharpened my problem-solving abilities, especially in embedded system applications and digital system design</p>
                <p>I’ve also had the privilege of organizing workshops, internships, and hackathons for students, and I collaborated on
                research that explored the future of web development and engineering education. These experiences not only strengthened
                my leadership and project management skills but also deepened my passion for applying emerging technologies to solve
                complex challenges.</p>
                <p>While I value my time in academia, I am highly motivated to bring my technical knowledge and dedication to learning into
                a hands-on industry role. The opportunity to contribute excites me I am confident that my background in embedded systems and web development, combined
                with my adaptability and eagerness to work in a team-oriented environment, will allow me to make valuable contributions
                to your organization.</p>

                <h4>Real time traffic management using Internet of Things</h4>
                <p>Many metropolitan cities are facing problems related to population explosion. These have leads to increase in vehicular
                density, resulting into traffic congestion. This variation in traffic Density hampers the speed of vehicles at the time
                of peak hours as well as regular time. The current infrastructures provides limited resources available to control of
                traffic congestion. To manage traffic flow real time traffic density management using IOT is used. It helps in
                optimization of traffic switching; controls traffic flow and prevent congestion's. These aspects are been made available
                on website to displays the traffic status, so that people will get early update and can avoid traffic jam and have
                alternative path. At time of Emergency vehicle can get early access to reach their destination.</p>

                <h4>Electricity generation using speed breaker</h4>
                <p>Electricity is generated by replacing the usual speed breakers with some simple mechanism. The rack and pinion system
                operates when a vehicle passes over the speed breakers, and it produces electricity with the aid of strong springs. With
                the number of automobiles growing constantly, this technique is a good way to produce electricity.</p>

                <h4>Heart Rate Monitor</h4>
                <p>Monitoring body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure are the basic things that we do keep us healthy. Heart Rate can
                be monitored When the heart expands the volume of blood inside the fingertip increases and when the heart contracts, the
                volume of blood inside the fingertip decreases. For this an IR sensor placed in close contact with the fingertip. When
                the heart beats, the volume of blood cells under the sensor increases and this reflects more IR waves to sensor and when
                there is no beat the intensity of the reflected beam decreases. The pulsating reflection is converted to a suitable
                current or voltage pulse by the sensor. The sensor output is processed by suitable electronic circuits to obtain a
                visible indication (digital display).</p>
